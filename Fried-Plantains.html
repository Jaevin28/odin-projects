    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 ripe plantain, peeled and cut into 1-inch rounds</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

       <p><strong>Step 1</strong>
    
        <p>Place a plate upside-down onto a work surface.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2</strong>
        
            <p>          Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Lower plantain slices carefully into the hot oil. Fry until slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the upside-down plate, using a slotted spoon, reserving oil in the skillet. Place a second plate, right-side up, onto plantains. Smash plantain slices by gently pressing top plate into bottom plate.
